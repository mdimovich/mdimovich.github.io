## My new blog 

My name is Michael Dimovich. I'm a software developer, aspiring writer, and a musician. I'm making this personal page to do some personal writing, explore my thoughts on tech-related subject matter, and to talk about my side projects. If you're interested in my writing and want to explore further, check out my blog [lfchf], which focuses more on self-improvement and general life advice.

Keep checking back for more info!
